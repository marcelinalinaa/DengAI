# DengAI: Predicting Disease Spread using Decision Tree

Our main purpose is to predict the dengue fever case in two cities, San Juan and Iquitos. The dataset is taken from [DengAI competition hosted by DrivenData](https://www.drivendata.org/competitions/44/dengai-predicting-disease-spread/). We will build the prediction model with decision tree. The model will be evaluated using Mean Absolute Error (MAE).
Our model managed to predict the dengue fever cases with MAE of 26.1971. We are in 2024th place among 10674 competitors.
