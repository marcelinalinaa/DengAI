# DengAI: Predicting Disease Spread using Decision Tree in R

Our main purpose is to predict the dengue fever case in two cities, San Juan and Iquitos. The dataset is taken from [DengAI competition hosted by DrivenData](https://www.drivendata.org/competitions/44/dengai-predicting-disease-spread/). We built the prediction model with decision tree. The model managed to predict the dengue fever cases with Mean Absolute Error of 26.1971. We are in 2024th place among 10674 competitors.
